text = 'One afternoon, after Mr spider had enjoyed his lunch, he sat down in his yard to relax.His lunch had been\n' \
       ' particularly nice, so soon enough he snoozed off into a slumber, and sat there snoring: nrrrroorrroogh! \n' \
       'nrrrroorrrroogh! nrrroorrrooogh!Suddenly there was the sound of someone knocking on the door, and this woke\n' \
       ' him up. Mr Spider opened the door, and there he saw Nana Petra. Spider said: “Eeh, Nana Petra, you \n' \
       'are welcome! It’s a long time since you called to see me.” He took his visitor inside the house, \n' \
       'and offered him everything he needed as a visitor. Mr Spider asked Nana Petra: “My brother, may I \n' \
       'know your intention of coming here at this crucial hour?”Nana Petra paused for some time, then spoke\n' \
       ' solemnly: “HmHmHm, it is sad news I bring you, brother spider.” Hearing this Mr Spider was confused\n' \
       ' and asked: “What is this sad news that you bring Nana Petra?”Nana Petra continued: “Your majesty, Mr \n' \
       'Spider, I am very sorry to announce to you the death of my father, Eja Mimou.” Now as Nana Petra was\n' \
       ' Ananse’s brother-in-law, this made Eja Mimou his father-in-law. When Ananse heard the news, he \n' \
       'could hardly believe it. So he asked his brother again: “Nana Petra, are you joking or are you serious?” \n' \
       'Nana Petra assured him that he was not joking, and eventually Ananse understood that his dear father-in-law\n' \
       ' was no more.Before Nana Petra left again, he told Ananse that the funeral and the rites would be held\n' \
       ' three days later in the residence of his late father-in-law. After Nana Petra left, Ananse went to see \n' \
       'his close friend, Mr Dog, and told him he would very much like him to accompany him to the funeral \n' \
       'and last rites of his departed father-in-law. Mr Dog agreed. When it was time to go to the funeral \n' \
       'Mr Spider told his friend Mr Dog he should carry along his guitar, so they could play some mournful \n' \
       'tunes at the funeral ground. They slowly made their way to the house where the funeral was taking place.\n' \
       ' Mr Spider had dressed himself in some very expensive cloth and put on a large dark hat to show his \n' \
       'respect for the deceased.When the friends arrived everybody was very excited, in spite of the fact \n' \
       'that there had been a bereavement, because Mr Spider was such a well known and great personality. \n' \
       'They were very happy to see him there, and he was offered one of the best seats in the house.\n' \
       ' Shortly after, Mr Spider asked the people to excuse him and went into the kitchen, where he found\n' \
       ' a large pot of beans on the fire. Mr Spider removed his hat, and dished a large quantity of the beans\n' \
       ' into the hat, which he then put back on his head, even though the hot beans made him squint.\n' \
       ' When he came back to his seat, he and his friend Mr Dog were offered food. Mr Dog ate all the food given\n' \
       ' him, but Mr Spider refused to eat. He explained: “I can never eat, since I am so bereaved because \n' \
       'my great father-in-law is no longer alive.” Mr Spider insisted that he would not touch any of the food.\n' \
       ' The people tried and tried and tried several times over to convince him, but all their efforts came to \n' \
       'nothing and he steadfastly refused.After some few hours Mr Spider said to the people that he would have \n' \
       'to leave, as there was another ceremony going on in the house of his own father where he also had \n' \
       'to attend. The people once again tried to persuade him to eat something before departing, but again \n' \
       'he steadfastly refused.While Mr Spider had been talking to the people, he had been nodding his head.\n' \
       ' He didn’t want to nod his head, but he couldn’t help it, the movement was forced on him by the \n' \
       'heat of the beans inside his hat. Some of the people noticed that he was nodding his head rather \n' \
       'a lot, and one of them asked: “Dear Mr Spider, Sir, why are you nodding your head so much?” \n' \
       'He answered in a loud voice: “When it’s hot like this, don’t you all shake your head?”\n' \
       'After that Mr Spider and his friend Mr Dog departed from the funeral ground. On their way home Ananse\n' \
       ' could not sustain the suffering the hot beans were causing to his poor head. The heat was just getting too\n' \
       ' too much! He finally had no choice: with a great scream he removed his large black hat and the beans \n' \
       'spilled out all over the street. Some people who had been walking along stopped to gaze at him, and \n' \
       'others came out of their houses, attracted by the commotion. One said: “This man, he is a foolish man!”\n' \
       'Another said: “He is not normal! What normal person would carry beans inside his hat and cover his \n' \
       'head with it?”Then Mr Dog said to his friend: “My dear Spider, whatever happened to your beautiful \n' \
       'hair?” Mr Spider touched his head, and noticed that all his hair had disappeared. The beans had been so \n' \
       'hot that they burned off all his hair, and from that moment onwards Mr Spider and all his offspring went\n' \
       ' around with a bald head.\n'
